- **🔢 Clean Organization:** Standardized naming convention (`nord_001.webp` to `nord_289.webp`) for easy scripting and usage.

## 🛠️ Processing Pipeline

The images in this repository were processed using [gowall](https://github.com/AaylaSecura/gowall):
1. **AI Upscaling:** Original 1080p images were upscaled to **4K** using the `realesrgan-x4plus` model for superior sharpness and detail preservation.
2. **Smart Compression:** Converted to WebP with `lossy` compression (Quality 80) to maximize space savings without visible artifacting.
3. **Standardization:** Renamed sequentially to ensure a clean filesystem structure.
